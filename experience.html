          <h1>The Job I Done</h1>
          <p>I used to be a combat Interpreter for the United State Armed forces in Afghanistan for over 5 years. I enjoyed my job and was pleased to serve beside special operation forces.</p>
          
          <p>After receiving a special imegration visa in september 2016, I and my family moved to the United States and started a new life. I have been driving for a rideshare company for almost 3 years. At the end of 2019 i feel i wasn't happy with my job and not enjoy the job i had. After a little bit of research and talking with a few friends who were students in Computer science, I decided to study and change my career for the rest of my life and I came up with Web Development and Programing. 1st i start with Udemy and learn a bit about web and computer language, after finished HTML & CSS courses, i decide to join Team Treehouse for better and more professional study on my Goals. Now this is my 1st project on a team treehouse learning platform and i'm so happy with the way i choose.</p>
